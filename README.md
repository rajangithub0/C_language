# C Programming Language

## Introduction
C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs. It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development due to its speed and efficiency.

## Features of C
- Simple and fast
- Structured programming language
- Portable across platforms
- Rich set of operators
- Supports low-level memory access using pointers

## Applications of C
- Operating systems (UNIX, Linux)
- Embedded systems
- Compilers
- Database systems
- Game development

## Basic Structure of a C Program

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
Advantages

-High performance

Better control over hardware

Large community support

Foundation for many modern programming languages

Conclusion

C is a powerful and fundamental programming language that helps build a strong base in programming and system-level concepts.
